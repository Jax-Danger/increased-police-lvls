# increased-police-lvls

This is just a fun resource I made with AI. Basically, use the commands `/wl [id] [level]` to make the player wanted with the specified level (1-5). What makes this different than a typical resource is, the script disables police to shoot if player has wanted level 1 or 2. It also increases the amount of police by spawning more npcs the higher the wanted level.
